This is still pretty rough! Let me know if you have any suggestions on how to improve it.

## Getting Started

1. update the names in the `players` array in `src/App.js`
2. replace the `png` images in the `src/images` folder with files that match the names in the `players` array (plus `.png`)
3. `yarn && yarn start`
4. click the game board to start the race

## TODO

- handle resizing gameboard on window resize after initial load
- reset gameboard on click while running or after finishing
- use right side of player image for crossing finish line (currently it's using the left side so wider images look like they're in the lead)
